      <description>Completed! I finished the Advent of Code for 2020, and this time pushed myself past the holiday indulgences to actually complete all 50 challenges!
I pushed myself to use Elixir for everything this year, and barring a few small instances where being able to mutate a value would have saved me a lot of headaches (specifically this evil creation) it was a pretty awesome experience. Aside from the usual 2D grid geometry problems, there were a lot of new things in there and I discovered some nice things on the way.</description>

      <description>In the past few weeks I discovered Omniglot and Anki and thought it&#39;d be pretty cool to be able to create flashcards for the useful phrases listing. Being able to say &amp;ldquo;this guy pays for everything&amp;rdquo; in Turkish, or &amp;ldquo;my hovercraft is full of eels&amp;rdquo; in Norwegian could be an incredibly useful life skill.
And so AnkiRB came into existence.
The library basically replicates what the application itself does when you create flashcards via the gui, except uses ruby&#39;s sqlite package to create flashcards and bundle media files together.</description>
