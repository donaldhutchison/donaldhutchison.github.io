      <description>Last weekend was the Berlin Global Game Jam 2014. I&#39;d made it part of a new years resolution plan to get more involved and release some games / projects, and this represented the first step towards doing something.
My awesome team and I worked all weekend making a twin stick style shooter in Unity. This was my first experience with Unity, and as such I spent most of the time watching tutorials and desparately deciphering the mysteries of Unity&#39;s component / entity system.</description>
