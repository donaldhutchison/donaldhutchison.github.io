      <description>Marvelroad was an app designed around an MVP for Mercedes owners. The idea was to both host a curated selection of enjoyable driving routes, as well as generate new routes and content based on user preferences. The user would provide a list of desirable features, such as landmarks, speed limits, nice views and driving time, and then the app would calculate a driving route based on these choices.
I was the sole developer for the backend of this app, and created a simple REST api which would provide the app with data and routes based on the user&#39;s choices.</description>
