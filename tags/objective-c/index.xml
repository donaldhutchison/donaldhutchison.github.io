      <title>Cocos2D-ObjC - Game Development Tookit for iOS</title>

      <description>The now defunct Cocos2D-ObjC project was a hugely successful games development library for developing iPhone games. Building on top of OpenGLES, it offered a more performant means of rendering graphics and manipulating visual objects than the UIKit based API offered by default. The scene graph API implemented in Cocos2D is now reflected in Apple&#39;s own SpriteKit framework.
After using the library for several years in a few mobile game projects, I got a position working as a full time maintainer of the library, making contributions to the core library as well as it&#39;s companion UI building app SpriteBuilder (analogous to Interface Builder for UIKit).</description>

      <description>Whether youâ€™re an expert developer or just getting started, SpriteBuilder will help you build top-quality games in a fraction of the time. Open source and free.o
 SpriteBuilder is an IDE designed around Swift / Objective C games development with the Cocos2D framework. Using SpriteBuilder you can visually design games and applications through the editor and know they will look consistent on both iOS and Android.
As one of the core team members I was responsible for working with the community, managing pull requests and helping guide the roadmap.</description>

      <title>Jelly Splash (Android &#43; iOS)</title>

      <description>Jelly Splash was a cross platform mobile game where the goal was to connect as many jellies as possible in order to beat the level and advance. Jelly Splash has had over 75 million players and was a huge success for Wooga.
As part of the core team, I was involved in daily feature development and maintenance. I focused heavily on the Android side in this project and was personally responsible for porting the game to the Kindle Fire store, where it was heavily featured and relatively successful given the market size.</description>

      <title>CCNode Recursive Description</title>

      <description>recusiveDescription is a pretty cool method. It&#39;s on each UIView, and when called it gives you a quick and dirty description of the current view hierarchy relative to that view.
Usually you&#39;d use this in the debugger, whilst on a breakpoint, to sanity check the positions and children of a view. This is a short gist that adds the same functionality to a CCNode subclass - the common subclass of most visual entities in a Cocos2d project.</description>
