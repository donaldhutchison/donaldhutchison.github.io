      <description>Note: This is a post I created for internal distribution when writing bug reports for mobile applications. I&#39;m sharing it here because I think it&#39;s useful for future situations.
 What&#39;s a bug report Bug reports exist only to inform people about software defects. They are not for notes, for tracking work done or for planning. There are better systems for this. The best bug reports will have as much appropriate information as possible to help asses get kicked as fast and effectively as possible.</description>
