## Bio
Donald Hutchison has been doing crazy things with computers since the age of 4. After gaining a degree, he started out in QA at [a small games company](http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/by_genre/developerId,422433/), before fighting his way [highlander style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6_H-PSml0) to his current occupation. 

He now works as a Game Developer at [King](http://www.king/) in Berlin, where he can be found working on some [awesome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wooga.jelly_splash&hl=en_GB) [games](/images/header3 copy.jpg) and generally being a pretty cool guy.
