Last weekend was the [Berlin Global Game Jam 2014](http://ggjberlin.de/). I'd made it part of a new years resolution plan to get more involved and release some games / projects, and this represented the first step towards doing something.

My [awesome team](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/damnhi) and I worked all weekend making a twin stick style shooter in Unity. This was my first experience with Unity, and as such I spent most of the time watching tutorials and desparately deciphering the mysteries of Unity's component / entity system. As such, I owe a lot to these guys for letting me hang around and break things. 

Unity is pretty cool, and I'm going to make a point of exploring it further for prototyping and short term projects. 

I really liked the game that we made, it's pretty fun to play - silly and frantic. As a bonus we came 3rd place in the public vote for Berlin, which is just super neat. It's definitely inspired me to be more active.

Checkout the game at [the global game jam site](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/damnhi).
