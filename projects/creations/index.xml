      <description>Marvelroad was an app designed around an MVP for Mercedes owners. The idea was to both host a curated selection of enjoyable driving routes, as well as generate new routes and content based on user preferences. The user would provide a list of desirable features, such as landmarks, speed limits, nice views and driving time, and then the app would calculate a driving route based on these choices.
I was the sole developer for the backend of this app, and created a simple REST api which would provide the app with data and routes based on the user&#39;s choices.</description>

      <description>Kiekmo was an Android app developed for Hamburg Sparkasse and designed to bring customers physically into the branch locations by offering a free item storage system (for use with online sales ala ebay). The customer would place an item within a locker provided at a Sparkasse branch and receive a lock code via the app. The customer would then provide the code to whoever purchased their item online and conveniently let the buyer access the item at will.</description>

      <description>Whether youâ€™re an expert developer or just getting started, SpriteBuilder will help you build top-quality games in a fraction of the time. Open source and free.o
 SpriteBuilder is an IDE designed around Swift / Objective C games development with the Cocos2D framework. Using SpriteBuilder you can visually design games and applications through the editor and know they will look consistent on both iOS and Android.
As one of the core team members I was responsible for working with the community, managing pull requests and helping guide the roadmap.</description>

      <description>Jelly Splash was a cross platform mobile game where the goal was to connect as many jellies as possible in order to beat the level and advance. Jelly Splash has had over 75 million players and was a huge success for Wooga.
As part of the core team, I was involved in daily feature development and maintenance. I focused heavily on the Android side in this project and was personally responsible for porting the game to the Kindle Fire store, where it was heavily featured and relatively successful given the market size.</description>
